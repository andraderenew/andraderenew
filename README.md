# Hi, I'm Rene Andrade Rey — Neuroimaging Researcher (MRI · fMRI · EEG/MEG · PET)

**Toolbox:** FreeSurfer · FSL/FEAT · SPM/CAT12 · Brainstorm · EEGLAB · FieldTrip · BRAPH · MATLAB  
**Focus:** morphometry • GLM • resting-state graphs • DTI • source imaging & PTE/dPTE • PET SUVR/PVC

## Selected projects (live as I build them)
- Structural MRI — CAT12 vs FreeSurfer (OASIS-1)
- Task fMRI — SPM Auditory GLM (+ FEAT replication)
- Resting-state — Graph metrics with BRAPH (ADHD-200 preprocessed)
- Diffusion — FA/MD + (mini) TBSS
- EEG — ERPs/Time-Frequency + cluster stats (EEGLAB/FieldTrip)
- EEG — Sources (LORETA/eLORETA) + directed connectivity (Brainstorm PTE)
- MEG — ERFs & sources (Brainstorm Median-nerve)
- PET — SUVR + partial-volume correction (PETPVE12)

## About me
Medical student at the University of Alcalá (expected 2025) with prior training in Biochemistry (UCM) and Computer Science (UPM). Hands-on with FreeSurfer, FSL, SPM/CAT12, EEGLAB, FieldTrip, Brainstorm, and BRAPH. I’m especially interested in functional connectivity, neurofeedback, and multimodal integration.  
Experience includes: Neurosurgical Simulation & AI Centre at the Montreal Neurological Institute, Neuroradiology at HUG, Geneva, and Interventional Radiology at CHUV, Lausanne. Honors include a Gold Medal in the Cuban National Chemistry Olympiad; I’m a co-author of a 2023 book chapter on palliative care and currently working on a Wilson’s disease case report and a systematic review/meta-analysis.
